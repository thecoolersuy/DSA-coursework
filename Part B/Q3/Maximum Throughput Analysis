(a) Max-Flow Modeling 

Source: Kathmandu (KTM)
Sink: Bhaktapur Shelter (BS)
Capacities: Represented by $c(u, v)$, the maximum trucks per hour on each road.

(b) Edmonds-Karp Execution

Note: Since the PDF does not provide the specific numerical capacity values for the edges in the text, I will describe the steps using typical capacity values to show you how to write the manual execution.

1. Find Augmenting Path: Use BFS to find the shortest path in the residual graph with available capacity (e.g., KTM → JA → BS).

2. Determine Bottleneck: Find the smallest capacity along that path (e.g., if KTM-JA is 10 and JA-BS is 7, bottleneck is 7).

3. Augment Flow: Push 7 units.

4. Update Residual Graph: Subtract 7 from forward capacities; add 7 to reverse capacities.

5. Repeat: Repeat until no more paths exist from KTM to BS in the residual graph.


(c) Final Max Flow and Min-Cut

After completing the steps above, the Final Max Flow is the sum of all pushed flow.
To demonstrate the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem:

1. Identify the "Cut" (a set of edges that, if removed, disconnect KTM from BS).

2. The sum of the capacities of the edges in the Minimum Cut will exactly equal the Maximum Flow value found in step (b).
